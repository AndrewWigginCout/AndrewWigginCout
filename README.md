FOR SALE: ENTRY LEVEL PROGRAMMER

I have a couple of technically challenging apps in my repo.

List of projects with sizes by lines:
|Title                                                          | line count|
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|[cube](https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/cube)               | 223|
|[stopwatches](https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/stopwatches) | 227|
|[bookmarks](https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/bookmarks)     | 207|
|[sha-1](https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/sha-1_passwords)		   | 94 |
|boggle		   | 80 |
|torcpp		   | 470|
|torpy		   | 220|
|matrix		   | 150|
|skyscrapers | 150|

There are no forks here. With the exceptions of sha-1 and torhcc++ where I include someone else's code to SHA-1 hash, everything here is written by me.

A 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube solver.
Cube was when I arrived, when I leveled up my programming ability and finally felt that I could figure out how to program anything. I had just finished DS and Algos so my eyes opened on how to intelligently use those principles in my code.

This verifies the file checksums of torrent payloads.
Tor Hash Check In C++ was me actually putting that newfound confidence to work. That was the first time I "collaborated" with someone else. I put that in quotes because all I did was use somebody else's library. But it was interesting because in C++ you can literally link your code bases together using the compiler. Python is so much simpler with an import statement, but alas, I hadn't learned Python yet.

This is a GUI app, a multi stopwatch. Good for time keeping your shifts.
In contrast to how I feel about the previous two, I don't think Stopwatches is anything remarkable. I feel now that Tkinter is a dead end; nobody is gonna pay me to do it. It's not robust I suspect.

[https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/sha-1_passwords](https://github.com/AndrewWigginCout/sha-1_passwords)
Although SHA-1 Passwords is a pretty simple idea, I think it's one of my cooler ideas. It's less code wizardry and more of a practical "life hack" if you will. Plus it's my most documented app, so check it out. The description and explanation is better than my essay here I think.

Lately instead of wasting my time building apps in the wrong language, or the wrong framework, I'm thinking of the bigger picture. I build with the intention of learning the skills that are in demand, and I learn and move on rather than spending a lot of time really figuring the nuances.

I suspect what corporate America is looking for is organization and documentation. I've failed a few interviews and coding challenges, and the only feedback I got back in return was "no". I wish you guys were more helpful, but I suspect that my code needs more comments. Yes? No? Any feedback would be appreciated.
